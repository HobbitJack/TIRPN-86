RPN program for TI-86
 -- Based on RPN86 (support for existing features)

5 Level Stack
X,Y,Z,T,R

) - Cycle Up
X->Y->Z->T->R->X
2nd [Quit] - Switch between RPN and EOS
Enter on blank
Push Stack; Y->X

TODO
ANS usable as "function" to push EOS ANS to stack; will be overwritten by TI math, but that's OK
Allow for accessing X, Y, Z, T, and R from EOS (i.e. store those vars to those TI-OS vars)
Increase availible functions (use entry as algebraic values for fnInt and deriv, X for A and Y for B?)?
( - Cycle Down
X->R->T->Z->Y->X
] - Swap X and Y
